Get High Together Â© Built with Start Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask By Jennalyn Kabiling & Brenner Haverlock

This website containing both front-end and back-end implentation is dedicated solely to highlighting cannabis strains and allowing individuals to freely communicate with one another about said strains through use of registration with the site, blog posts, and comments.

In order to run this site, you will need to download the requirements in the requirements.txt file. And then type in "flask run" in your terminal. 

There are two branches (main and master) in our GitHub repo link. The main branch is designated for front-end framework only. The master branch has both the front-end and back-end technologies merged together. Download the master branch and then download the requirements found in the "requirements.txt" file and type in "flask run" in your terminal once all requirements are downloaded. The site should then deploy with a link provided in the terminal.
