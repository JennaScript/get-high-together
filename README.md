This website containing both front-end and back-end implentation is dedicated solely to highlighting cannabis strains and allowing individuals to freely communicate with one another about said strains through use of registration with the site, blog posts, and comments.

In order to run this site, you will need to download the requirements in the requirements.txt file. 

There are two branches (main and master) in our GitHub repo link. The main branch is designated for front-end framework only. The master branch has both the front-end and back-end technologies merged together. Download the master branch and then download the requirements found in the "requirements.txt" file. Once finished downloading all required technologies, in your terminal, navigate the file directory the entire project is in and type in "export FLASK_APP=app.py" and then follow with typing in "flask run" in your terminal. The site should then deploy with a link provided in the terminal.
